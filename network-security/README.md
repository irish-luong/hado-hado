## NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL

### Elements of NAC (Ebook page 519)

1. Access  requester (AR)
2. Policy server
3. Network access server

### Network Access Enforment Methods
1. IEEE 802.1X: link layer protocal
2. Virtual local area network (VLANs)
3. Firewall: Check and deny some network traffic from enteprise host and external user.
4. DHCP management: Dynamic Host Configurarion Protocol enables dynamic allocation of IP address to host.

### Cloud sercirity risk and countermeasure
Similar lists have been developed by the European Network and Information Security Agency [ENIS09] and NIST [JANS11].

| Security threat  | Countermeasure |
| -----------  | ----------- |
| Abuse and nefarious use |(1) stricter initial registration and valida- tion processes; (2) enhanced credit card fraud monitoring and coordination; (3) comprehensive introspection of customer network traffic; and (4) monitor- ing public blacklists for oneâ€™s own network blocks |
| Insecure interface and APIs | (1) analyzing the security model of CP inter- faces; (2) ensuring that strong authentication and access controls are imple- mented in concert with encrypted transmission; and (3) understanding the dependency chain associated with the API|
| Malicious insiders |(1) enforce strict supply chain management and conduct a comprehensive supplier assessment; (2) specify human resource requirements as part of legal contract; (3) require transpar- ency into overall information security and management practices, as well as compliance reporting; and (4) determine security breach notification processes.|
| Shared technology issues |(1) implement security best practices for installation/configuration; (2) monitor environment for unauthor- ized changes/activity; (3) promote strong authentication and access control for administrative access and operations; (4) enforce SLAs for patching and vulnerability remediation; and (5) conduct vulnerability scanning and configuration audits.|
| Data loss and leakage | (1) implement strong API ac- cess control; (2) encrypt and protect integrity of data in transit; (3) analyze data protection at both design and run time; and (4) implement strong key generation, storage and management, and destruction practices.| 
| Account and service hijacking |(1) prohibit the sharing of account credentials between users and services; (2) leverage strong two-factor authentication techniques where possible; (3) employ proactive monitoring to detect unauthorized activity; and (4) understand CP security policies and SLAs.|
| Unknow risk profile | (1) Disclosure of applicable logs and data. (2) Partial/full disclosure of infrastructure details. (3) Monitoring and alerting on necessary information|
